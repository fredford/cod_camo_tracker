# COD Camo Tracker

## Description

This application was created to provide a method for tracking a user's progress in collecting Camos from the video-game series Call of Duty. This was done as the in-game system for tracking your progress is limited and requires a high number of menu swapping. The application solves this problem by displaying all of the challenge requirements, and your current progress points.
